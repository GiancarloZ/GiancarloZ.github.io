Metaprogramming is a way to have a multi-level expression of a code, and smoothens its application and execution, through representation of ideas and codes through a clean and symbolic way. A way that I always explained metaphors to students is that the feeling from a metaphor is a much easier way to understand the feeling and concept of something, as opposed to having a person always explain exactly what they mean or how they felt, through basic words. Essentially, a person has to have a good grasp on the ideas of something in order to either understand a metaphor or express one.

In a way, this is extremely similar to metaprogramming. You have to have a understanding of the things a class is meant to represent, do, and interact with, in order to be able to implement it in a different class. Instead of writing long tedious codes and methods for every class, Obect Relationships allow a programmers to build several objects, or lives, allow those lives to have interests, hobbies, and activities. Not only that, but in the world we live in, all of us interact in one way or another. I have an idea about myself, but I am not stand alone, just like classes. I also have to interact with others, which involve either intitutions that we all mutually join, or the affects of someone's actions and policies on my identity, socioeconomic class, gender, and geographical positioning. In this way, it's easy to see how a class's can affect multiple objects, and how those objects can be related through a common experience or action. 

A really easy way to think about it is the design of an institution, responsible for employees, CEOs, and funders. All are brought together by the institution, but the actions of each affects the other. Employees doing a good job allows for confidence in funding and CEO decisions. CEO decisions affect employee compensation and funder confidence. Policy and agenda of funders affect the function and success of the others. The intitutions is the @@all. and the self (whether employee, CEO, or funder) affect how the @@all, or institution, operates given contributions by all the classes involved.
