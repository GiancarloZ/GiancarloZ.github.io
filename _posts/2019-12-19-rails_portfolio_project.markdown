This was the first project where I did not have an idea ready by the time I got to the project section. This was definitely not an ideal situation for me as I felt even more stressed, not just from feeling completely unprepared and from not fully grasping all the concepts, but from having to come up with a good idea that has all of the requirements. Thankfully, I was able to meet up with a friend of mine who told me about a website he would like that would have his own blog about topics he is interested in and also sell merchandise directly from the website. Although, this is not the most original idea it did combine everything that we've learned from the lessons or the labs in the Rails section. 

Once again, nothing really ingrains the concepts learned more than starting and completing a project from scratch. Between trial and error and googling, I feel this project really helped me understand the connections between the routes and controllers, controllers and models, html and form tags and form fors, the activerecord associations, nested resources, but also login/authentication and sessions. There is still so much more I need to learn and understand to be a proficient full stack web developer but I feel much more confident in my abilities and my capacity to learn more and become a better programmer. 

Some of the areas of improvement (which I'll still be doing until my assessment) is refactoring. I feel I understand the concepts and separation of concerns but also feel there are much better and more efficient ways to code. I understand that you shouldn't have logic in your html pages but still find myself using if/else statements for what can be shown and in some area's i do repeat code but am not confident enough yet in understanding when to make it a helper method and when to unclutter the logic in the controllers. My goal is always to make the application work as I need it to and then refactor to make it more efficient. Since I'm trying to get through the course as quickly as possible without impeding my learning and undertanding of the concepts, I'm excited to come back to these projects with a better understanding of how to accomplish the same tasks in the most efficient way as possible. ON TO JAVASCRIPT! 

Please feel free to check out my project at the repo below and I always welcome feedback (good or bad)!
