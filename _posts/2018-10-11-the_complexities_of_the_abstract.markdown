One way that I see code relating directly to the real world is the idea of thinking in the same language, or way, as others without having to explain the complexities behind the motivation. We often use coded language in today's society, and cultural capital allows people to skip the abstract of the language and its role in our culture. One thing that I've noticed is that people often use the function of language to convey cultural capital, which allows them to bypass tedious ways to gain acceptance or get their mission across. 

In terms of metaprogramming, specifically, it allows us to use efficiencies to avoid complicated and mutually inefficient "code", or explanation, to avoid tension and get to the intersectionality of mutual interest and benefit for all parties involved. Similarly, as with cultural capital, one has to orient their thinking to the language and its purpose, in order to execute it to their utmost benefit. It is extremely difficult for someone from a different culture, especially with language and codes that words hold behind them, to bypass tedious interactions to advance to functionality. Similarly, it is difficult to understand the purpose of a code and a language's functionality, if one has not immersed themselves in the way the language operates and its purpose during execution. 

Another interesting commonality between coding and language is its time to process ratio. In real life, especially in a capitalist society, we are often trying to find the most efficient and beneficial cost to time ratio. This thinking is all around us, and is deeply engrained in us. Writing long tedious code, which will eventually break or malfunction due to its inappropriate attention to detail, is the same as having a boring, tedious, and difficult job that does not allow for luxuries in terms of compensation, or pleasure in terms of enrichment. Because of this, we often trade off our time for either material or spiritual gain, and a long process of finding a career or passion is the constant recalculation or analyzation of life choices that give us the most functionality in the shortest amount of time. 

This is especially important when we think about, not only our personal life decisions, but also larger policy issues and implications. Given the recent articles about climate change, and especially the equity issues regarding healthcare and college debt, we have to start thinking if the slow and malfunctional way we are moving as a society, which is not helping us progress or be efficient, is the best way to bypass inefficiency. I know this is making things very simple, but those who make decisions about the rest of us need to evaluate if the amount of benefit they get now, by keeping society back at large, is ultimately beneficial to them as well. If a code is reliant on all of its functionality, across classes and modules, isn't a society's functionality at the mercy of all of its socioeconomic classes functioning as well?
