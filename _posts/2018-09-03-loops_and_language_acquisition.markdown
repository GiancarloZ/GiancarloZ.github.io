As a literacy teacher, I always found the acquisition of language and its impact on the way we think really facinating. What has been a challenge in Looping, and Ruby in general, had been having to rewire my brain to thinking in really technical terms, specific to the language, but also knowing which type of code to write and when. I remember being a ESL student, and being really confused as to why there were different types of sentence structures, or 90 words for the same idea. I remember being really rustrated and thinking that they were all the same thing. The only thing that really helped me get over that was seeing how different contexts lend themselves to different ways of executing an idea. I guess at this point, it's easy to know what type of code to use for when, because it's put right in the title (also annoying because I had finally felt good about Arrays, Puts, and Conditionals!). however, I do grow nervouse, when left on my own, will I struggle to really pin point the code selection?

These were all things that I became refamiliarized with, and finally understood why some of my students, and even myself, struggle in adolescence with concepts that seem to abstract or complicated. I found myself nervous, but I realize it's so early in my actual coding, that I shouldnt necessarily be disappointed in myself if I can't fully master a new language and concept.
