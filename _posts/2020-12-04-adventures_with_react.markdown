I have officially completed my React/Redux final project located at [congress-votes-app](http://www.congress-votes-react.herokuapp.com). I originally built most of this project with classes and all the tools I was taught in the bootcamp. While building out this project, I came to learn about Hooks! This project ended up taking me a little longer than expected becuase I decided to read through the entire documentation on Hooks so that I could rebuild this app using the most up to date features. As I was re-building my app, I discovered Material-UI as well and its wonderful features. So I decided to also read through the material-ui documentation and try implementing this with Hooks for my final project. 

The project that I decided to build, which you can find at link above, was to create an app for looking up information about congress (a bill or a congressperson). I decided to use the ProPublica API for all of my information. The app loads the Home Page where I fetch initial list of members and bills and display an autocomplete search bar under Senate Members, Bills, and House Members. Once a member or bill is selected, it will fetch the appropriate information for that person or bill to be displayed to the user in an accordian that responds to a click to show hidden details.  I built a Rails API with a User model to allow sign up/login as well as a profile page. Thank you and I hope you enjoy the app!
